# Pallanguzhi Game Rules Reference

## Traditional Rules (பல்லாங்குழி விதிகள்)

### Board Setup
- 14 pits arranged in two rows of 7 pits each
- Each pit starts with 6 stones (கற்கள்)
- Middle pits (position 3 and 10) start with 12 stones
- Total of 96 stones on the board

### Movement Rules
- Stones move counter-clockwise (எதிர் கடிகார திசை)
- Player picks up all stones from one of their pits
- Distributes stones one by one in subsequent pits
- Cannot move from empty pits

### Capture Rules (கைப்பற்றுதல்)
- Capture occurs when last stone lands in empty opponent pit
- All stones in adjacent pits are also captured
- Captured stones are added to player's score
- The pit where the last stone landed is also captured

### Bonus Turn Rules (கூடுதல் முறை)
- Get bonus turn when last stone lands in own pit with even number
- Player continues their turn
- No bonus if pit has odd number of stones

### Winning Conditions (வெற்றி நிபந்தனைகள்)
- Game ends when all pits on one side are empty
- Remaining stones are added to respective player scores
- Player with most stones wins
- Tie if both players have equal stones

### Strategic Elements
- **Stone Distribution**: Manage stones across pits for mobility
- **Capture Timing**: Set up captures while avoiding opponent captures  
- **Bonus Turns**: Chain bonus turns for multiple moves
- **Defensive Play**: Prevent opponent from getting easy captures
- **Endgame**: Force opponent's side to empty first
